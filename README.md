# Weather Colors

## Current weather and forecast with colors

Weather Colors is an opensource project developed in Flutter for multiple platforms.

It's main page shows the current weather and local time simultaneously for multiple cities. Each city is shown as a tile colorized according to its current temperature.

By default cities are ordered by temperature rendering a beautiful progressive color list.

A details page presents forecast info and charts for any city you choose. All weather information is also colorized according to its magnitude scale, for example: wind speed is colorized according to wind speed scale, both on numerical values and chart lines and bars.

The result is beautiful, meaningful and consistent.

Weather data is provided by OpenWeather, Timezone info is provided by TimeAPI. Charts are presented using Syncfusion engine.

The source code is freely available in GitHub and this application is used as a case study for instructional content. Please visit our site for further information.
